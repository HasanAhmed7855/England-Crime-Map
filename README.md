# England-Crime-Map
Using the Police API and Javascript Google Maps API, users can view crimes committed in England.

Users can:
- See different crime types plotted on an interactive map with markers. Markers can be clicked to view more information about the crime
- Search their neighbourhood to see the crimes in that particular neighbourhood
- Can view a summary of the crimes in the searched neighbourhood

Monthly crime information comes from [Police API](https://data.police.uk/). Therefore, the map may not have up-to-date information if the information coming from the Police API hasn't been updated.

Mobile view for very small screen sizes needs optimising.

P.S. The project code isn't optimised and doesn't contain good software engineering practices, this project is just to demonstate functionality.
